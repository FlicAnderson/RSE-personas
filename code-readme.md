# Code

This is where the code for the project will be held. 

### TESTS 

To run all pytest tests on code, from `coding-smart/` folder (ensuring all packages from requirements.txt are installed, especially `pytest`), run:   

```commandline
(coding-smart-github) flic@persephone:~/coding-smart$ pytest tests/
========================================== test session starts ==========================================

This example is currently showing my poor pytest test writing skills but is informative on running one set of tests at least.
